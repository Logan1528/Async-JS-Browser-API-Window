Q1.Define XMLHttpRequest object, and How is it used in AJAX?

Define XMLHttpRequest object

	The XMLHttpRequest object is a JavaScript API that provides functionality 
for making asynchronous HTTP requests from a web page. It allows the web page to 
communicate with a server in the background without interfering with the user's 
experience. XMLHttpRequest is commonly used in AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
 to update parts of a web page dynamically without requiring a full page reload.

Here's a brief overview of how it's used in AJAX:

1. **Create an instance**: First, you create an instance of the XMLHttpRequest 
object in your JavaScript code.

2. **Open a connection**: You use the `open()` method of the XMLHttpRequest 
object to specify the type of request (e.g., GET, POST) and the URL of the 
server-side script or resource you want to communicate with.

3. **Set up event handlers**: You typically set up event handlers to handle 
various stages of the request, such as when the request completes successfully
 (`onload`), encounters an error (`onerror`), or progresses (`onprogress`).

4. **Send the request**: You use the `send()` method of the XMLHttpRequest 
object to send the request to the server.

5. **Handle the response**: When the server responds to the request, the `onload`
 event handler (or other appropriate event handler) is triggered, and you can 
access the response data from the `responseText` or `responseXML` properties of
 the XMLHttpRequest object. You then typically update the relevant parts of the
 web page with the received data.

6. **Optional: Abort the request**: You can also abort an ongoing request using 
the `abort()` method of the XMLHttpRequest object if needed.

Overall, XMLHttpRequest enables asynchronous communication between a web page and 
a server, facilitating the dynamic updating of web content without requiring a 
full page reload.
